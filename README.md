# Transit-Reviewer
A platform for the people of Waterloo region to review the service of Grand River Transit Services. This program uses Java, SpringBoot and MongoDB on the backend to manage the route data, and makes use of React, and other JavaScript frameworks and methods on the frontend. Farhan Hasin Chowdhury and Gavin Lon put out a great how-to for these technologies, for which I am eternally grateful for. 

I've always felt that people should be able to review the transit they ride just as they are able to review restaurants, movies, hotels and many other things. Public transporation is a great public service, however, people generally are not prepared for the hiccups that come along with it. As such, I've created a reviewing system for anonymous riders to review their chosen route, giving anecdotal suggestions to new riders embarking on their own journies.

Ps. The Internet may be the most helpful place on the planet (how else would I debug, get passed that one small error and move on?)
